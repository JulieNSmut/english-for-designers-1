## Writing Style

I want to write clearly, and not be afraid to add a little humor into the text to bring a friendly and helpful tone to my writing style.

## Voice

1. Genuine
2. Original
3. Educational
4. Friendly

## Tone

1. Write effectively
2. Be Positive
3. Use humor for relief
4. Be friendly
5. Be careful when choosing certain words
For example:
When choosing the right words, we need to consider which target group we are talking about. 
For example, we will choose simple words for children, not too long, and we will speak in a playful way. 
For teenagers, we choose words that do not offend them and we speak carefully and try to be friendly. 
For adults (for example, university students) we choose words and tones that will not bore them, but at the same time we give them new information and new expressions, which we use to teach them to communicate properly.
