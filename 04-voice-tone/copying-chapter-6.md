## Copying Chapter 6
Copying definitely belongs to the lives of all of us, and we may not even realize it. 
You have the knowledge you have that you have acquired from someone. So you copy his thoughts and have them stored in your head as your own. 
He also had to copy that knowledge somewhere and learn it. As long as people live and learn in the world, copying will always be there.

Nowadays, I have noticed the topic of copying mainly in the film industry. 
Film studios have begun to rework old animated films into new ones with better graphics and more realistic character rendering, but it's still just one story. 
For example: The Lion King, Snow White, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast. 
Overall, the movies are similar to each other, for example in teen American movies, the main character of a woman is always shy, she is in love with the most beautiful boy 
at school, who is mostly in the football team, has a best friend who is crazy and the main character's life is disturbed by the mean rich girls. 
Eventually, the boy usually falls in love with the shy girl and ends up together at the prom, where they kiss and everyone will be happy.
And this is how it is in thousands of teen films.

Of course, no one can claim that he is not copying. I also copy in my designs. Always before starting a project, I find a few pictures of the so-called moodboards. 
I'm inspired by Behance, Pinterest or Google. I'm using a color palette that someone has created before. 
Download a font created by someone. I will just get inspiration from other designers and this will create my new design.
