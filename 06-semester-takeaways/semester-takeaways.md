# Five Things I Learned This Semester

1. GITHUB! I learned to work at Github. I already feel like a little programming expert
2. I learned how to create a quality CV that will help me respond to job offers.
3. I learned to communicate and write better in English
4. I learned using a https://www.grammarly.com/ and http://www.hemingwayapp.com/ for better writing style. 
5. And of course, a lot of other things that I owe thank to our amazing Professor Justin Gagne! 
For his patience, always willingness to help, helpfulness, and support throughout the semester.
