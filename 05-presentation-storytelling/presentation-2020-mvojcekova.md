# PRIMARY SCHOOL
I started to be interested in design as such at primary school, where I edited photos in various unpaid programs, 
I edited videos for my friends and drew various characters on paper on my free time.

# APPLY FOR HIGH SCHOOL
When we had to decide where to apply for high school, I didn't hesitate to go to Secondary Vocational school, which offered study section - graphic of digital media.

# HIGH SCHOOL
At this school, they taught us how to work in Adobe graphics programs, we learned to take and edit photos, shoot short videos and then edit them, 3D modeling, we learned how created logos and printed materials, how created animations and basics of creating web pages. I enjoyed everything and I was slowly learning things that a good designer should know.

# MY FIRST DESIGNS
I'll show you some of my first designs from my High School. They're not perfect, but the beginnings are always difficult, and despite all the mistakes, I'm proud of them because they started my passion for design.

This is one of my first 3D models in Blender. The topic our professor assigned us was "fence." So I created a garden with a swing, a bench, and a well.

And this is one of the first illustrations I created in Adobe Illustrator. Of course, if I do not count the first wheels, squares, and houses. It is a drawing of an actress from the American Horror Story series.

# CONTINUE?
In the last years of my high school studies, I decided that I wanted to continue my education in this field because I enjoyed it, it brought me joy and I was clear in what I want to do after school. So I applied to the University of Creative Communication in Prague, which fascinated me with its approach, and I was very much looking forward to being able to join this school.

# LIFE ON UNIVERSITY
At this school, I learned many new things that I will use in my future career. For example creation of corporate identities, the creation of prototypes of applications and websites, the basics of typography, the basics of marketing communication, typesetting, and a lot of lectures with professionals in our field. So let’s see some my work on this university.
