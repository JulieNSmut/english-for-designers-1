In this presentation, I decided to tell my story as a designer.
I started to be interested in design as such at primary school, where I edited photos in various unpaid programs in the evenings, edited videos for my friends and drew various characters on paper. When we had to decide where to apply for high school, I didn't hesitate to learn about digital media graphics

At this school, they taught us how to work in Adobe graphics programs, we learned to take and edit photos, shoot short videos and then edit them,
3D modeling, creation of logos and accidental printed matter, creation of animations and basics of creating web pages.
I really enjoyed everything and I was slowly learning things that a good designer should know.

I'll show you some of my first designs. (They're terrible, but the beginnings are always difficult, and despite all the mistakes, I'm proud of them because they started my passion for design.)

In the last years of my high school studies, I decided that I wanted to continue my education in this field, because I enjoyed it, it brought me joy and I was clear
in what I want to do after school.
So I applied to the University of Creative Communication in Prague, which fascinated me with its approach, professionals who will teach us, and I was very much looking forward to being able to join this school.
At this school, I learned many new things that I will definitely use in my future career. Whether the creation of corporate identities, the creation of prototypes of applications and websites, the basics
typography, basics of marketing communication, typesetting and of course gave me a lot of lectures with professionals in our field.

Here are some of my works from my previous studies at VŠKK.

My big inspiration in design is Pavel Fuksa, czech graphic designer, illustrator and creator of advertising campaigns.
He has worked for Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook, The Independent, Nike, Heineken and Budweiser. 
For former US President Barrack Obama formed a campaign on Youtube.

Furthermore, I am inspired by various pages on Instagram or Behance, which are full of incredibly talented artists, designers, and in their work I always 
say to myself that I will one day create such perfect designs.

In my designs, I constantly try to move, try new things, new trends and I constantly try to improve and learn from the best. After all, we learn all our lives. And I want to focus on design, learn and improve the world with my works.

Thank you for your attention and stay creative.
