My name is Miriam and I study graphic design.
I'm more of an introvert in my projects and I like to work on everything myself. 
I don't mind working in a team, it's an interesting experience, but I prefer when I can work alone. 
After school I would like to be a freelancer. 
In my projects, I try to bring everything down to the last detail, I try to work with an open mind and full creativity.
Dreamy woman with big dreams. Lover of travel, cooking, art and design. 
I try to create creative solutions to unsolvable problems. 
I try to go 100% in everything, because if you don't do it properly, then you don't have to do it at all.
